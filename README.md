# Chest X-Ray Diagnosis with Deep Learning

This project is a recreation of the "Chest X-Ray Medical Diagnosis with Deep Learning" assignment from the [AI for Medical Diagnosis Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-for-medicine) by DeepLearning.AI. It demonstrates how to build and evaluate a deep learning model that can detect multiple diseases in chest X-ray images.

## Project Objectives

- Load and preprocess the CheXpert chest X-ray dataset.
- Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Train and evaluate the model using ROC and AUC metrics.
- Interpret model predictions with Grad-CAM visualizations.
